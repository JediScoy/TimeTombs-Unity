During his lifetime he was primarily known for his achievements in meteorology and as a pioneer of polar research, but today he is most remembered as the originator of the theory of continental drift by hypothesizing in 1912 that the continents are slowly drifting around the Earth (German: Kontinentalverschiebung). His hypothesis was controversial and not widely accepted until the 1950s, when numerous discoveries such as palaeomagnetism provided strong support for continental drift, and thereby a substantial basis for today's model of plate tectonics.[4][5] Wegener was involved in several expeditions to Greenland to study polar air circulation before the existence of the jet stream was accepted. Expedition participants made many meteorological observations and were the first to overwinter on the inland Greenland ice sheet and the first to bore ice cores on a moving Arctic glacier.","/str",{"VAR=":"WegenerAbout"},"str","^Captain Hess","/str",{"VAR=":"Hess"},"str","^ Harry Hammond Hess (May 24, 1906 – August 25, 1969) was a geologist and a United States Navy officer in World War II. Considered one of the 'founding fathers' of the unifying theory of plate tectonics, Rear Admiral Harry Hammond Hess was born on May 24, 1906, in New York City. He is best known for his theories on sea floor spreading, specifically work on relationships between island arcs, seafloor gravity anomalies, and serpentinized peridotite, suggesting that the convection of the Earth's mantle was the driving force behind this process. This work provided a conceptual base for the development of the theory of plate tectonics.","/str",{"VAR=":"HessAbout"},"str","^","/str",{"VAR=":"Season05Hook"},"str","^move along trying be undetected","/str",{"VAR=":"MoveStealth"},"str","^walk","/str",{"VAR=":"MoveWalk"},"str","^move briskly","/str",{"VAR=":"MoveHustle"},"str","^run","/str",{"VAR=":"MoveRun"},{"list":{"inventory.none":1}},{"VAR=":"inventory"},{"list":{"kits.zero":1}},{"VAR=":"kits"},{"list":{},"origins":["weapons"]},{"VAR=":"weapons"},{"list":{"armor.none":1}},{"VAR=":"armor"},{"list":{"healing.none":1}},{"VAR=":"healing"},{"list":{"specialItems.none":1}},{"VAR=":"specialItems"},{"list":{"ore.none":1}},{"VAR=":"ore"},"str","^meteorite ore","/str",{"VAR=":"ore30"},"str","^palladium ore","/str",{"VAR=":"ore31"},"str","^thorium ore","/str",{"VAR=":"ore32"},"str","^the Sickle of Cronus","/str",{"VAR=":"EpicWeapon"},"str","^The Sickle of Cronus is used to battle the beast in the Time Tombs.

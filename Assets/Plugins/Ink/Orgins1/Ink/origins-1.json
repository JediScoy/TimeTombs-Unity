He used the idea of elliptical orbits to describe the motions of the planets, which became known as Kepler's first law. His second law states that a line from the Sun to a planet sweeps out equal areas in equal amounts of time which basically means as orbiting objects like planets get closer to the sun they speed up and when farther away they go slower. Later, the third law was developed: the square of the number of years of a planet's orbital period is equal to the cube of that planet's average distance from the Sun.","/str",{"VAR=":"KeplerAbout"},"str","^(1) The orbit of a planet is an ellipse with the Sun at one of the two foci. (2) A line segment joining a planet and the Sun sweeps out equal areas during equal intervals of time. (3) The square of the orbital period of a planet is directly proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit.","/str",{"VAR=":"KeplersLaws"},"str","^Mr. Lyell","/str",{"VAR=":"Lyell"},"str","^Author of Principles of Geology, like Hutton, stated that planet's processes today are similar to those of the past.

The mages are notoriously reclusive and have offered little information to anyone - even the Queen herself.

You've been hydrating, now it's time to refuel. Each member tries a couple different foods. Another 30 minutes passes and you all feel varying amounts of energy.","\n","^Alatar: \"I suggest taking a 5 minute rest and perhaps massage or stretch sore muscles. During that time I can perform a short alchemy test on the different foods. This will let us know the basic components of the food. I've heard some wizards or alchemists refer these components as macromolecules or macronutrients. In any case, once we figured what foods seem to work best for each of us and know their main components we can customize our diet for maximum energy release.","\n","^After the short rest, the food analysis is performed and each runner does some reflection on how they are feeling. Darius learns that he tends to eat foods high in protein and fat. He finds that eating foods with similar amounts of protein and fat make him feel better. The remaining team members didn't share much in common with food before running. Now though they all seem to feel better eating high carbohydrate based foods.","\n","^Your party of runners continues in this way for a total of 12 hours. Each runner experiences highs and lows, but the party trudges on up the trail and mountain. During this time, the druid in pronghorn form seems just fine.","\n","^The party finally enters the small village of Leadville.","\n","^Aer grabs a nearby man: \"Where is your healer?!\"","\n","^The startled man points to a small stone and thatch hut on the back edge of the village, tucked up in the pines and a crook of the mountain.","\n","^The party makes its way across the gravelly town square. The villagers give you nervous looks.","\n","^You waste no time knocking, and instead barge into the hut.","\n","^A woman is sitting in front of a small pot heating over the fire pit. She is wearing a blue cloak and a headpiece of black lamb trimmed with white ermine. In her left hand she has a brass staff with adorned with gems.","\n","^ThorbjÇ«rg: \"Greetings weary adventurers. I am ThorbjÇ«rg.\"","\n","^You: \"We are here because we were told your village has potions or herbs that may heal a sick girl in Canis Villa.\"","\n","^Thorsbjorg: \"I know why you are here.\"","\n","^Darius looks confused.","\n","^You: \"We just ran for 12 hours. I hope you also know where to find the medicine or magic we need.\"","\n","^Thorsbjorg: \"The medicine you seek is a fungus grown in a particular cave three miles up the mountain. You will find no path to it - both humans and animals know to stay away. Head northwest out of the village and keep climbing until you reach a very tall, unique looking cave entrance. Inside you will find a white puffball fungi. I suggest being extra alert and checking your surroundings often.\"","\n","^Darius: \"So we have to run farther up the mountain and something presumably dangerous waits for us. Great.\"","\n","^Thorsbjorg continues: \"Bring a handful of the fungus to me and I will create a drinkable potion.\"","\n","^Alatar: \"Thank you Thorsbjorg!\"","\n","^The party enters a large mouthed cave. You scan the area as best as you can, but you are also trying to hurry. After all, there is a sick child waiting for your return.","\n","^The cave is dimly lit, but not dark yet at this distance inside.","\n","^About 20 feet ahead, you notice an area covered with white-ish colored puffball fungi.","\n","^Suddenly the side of the cave seems to come alive. A massive stone giant - using stone camouflage - has now stepped out into the center of the cave between you and the mushrooms. His granite-gray skin, gaunt features, and black, sunken eyes stare at the party before it sternly. Its carrying a great club in its right hand and resting the larger end in its left hand. It appears hugely muscular but lithe and graceful at the same time.","\n","^What do you do?","\n","^You have defeat the giant as it collapses onto the cave floor. You quickly run past the large body and grab the fungus. You waste no time leaving the cave and heading back to Leadville.","\n","^The healer smiles as you enter the hut. You are unsure if its a maniacal smile or one of pleasant surprise. You still don't know, but after a moments hesitation you all enter, and she takes the fungi. She brews a foul smelling potion for Becca to drink.","\n","^Healer: \"Be sure she drinks half of the immediately upon your return and the other half the next day. She must drink it ALL. If she does not, she will get better from half of the potion but the sickness will return within a few days and be even stronger. She would not survive the second strain.\"","\n","^You thank her for help and run out the door.","\n","^You step onto the trail back to Canis Villa already tired before the second half of your race has begun. It is physically harder to be sure, but mentally it is easier going back now which seems to somehow make the trip easier.","\n","^You make it to within 10 miles of Canis Villa when the druid starts to struggle. During the run he has been both pronghorn and wolf. The animals have performed equal to his human counterparts and sometimes better. However, both animal forms are struggling now. Their overall constitution, or health and endurance, seems to be failing especially as the heat as continued to rise.","\n","^The druid decides to stop for a break while the rest of continue on to the finish so close now. You arrive into Canis Villa without fanfare. In fact, everyone is looking quite gloom. Those that do notice your party of weary adventures change to shock when they realize what you accomplished.","\n","^You enter hut and give the potion to her father who coerces her to drink it. You leave them be and let her relax.","\n","^The next day she seems to be more recovered than your party! You remind her father that she must drink the other half, lest the illness comeback even stronger. She complies.","\n","^By the end of the week both your party and Becca have made a full recovery.","\n","ev","str","^START MENU","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^NEXT","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"1StartMenu"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"1Ep3"},"done",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"1Ep3":[["^<h3>","ev",{"VAR?":"1EpisodeThree"},"out","/ev","^</h3>","\n","ev","str","^START MENU","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^NEXT","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"1StartMenu"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"1Ep4"},"done",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"1Ep4":[["^<h3>","ev",{"VAR?":"1EpisodeFour"},"out","/ev","^</h3>","\n","ev","str","^START MENU","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^NEXT","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"1StartMenu"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"1Ep5"},"done",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"1Ep5":[["^<h3>","ev",{"VAR?":"1EpisodeFive"},"out","/ev","^</h3>","\n","ev","str","^START MENU","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-0","flg":4},"ev","str","^NEXT","/str","/ev",{"*":".^.c-1","flg":4},{"c-0":["\n",{"->":"1StartMenu"},{"#f":5}],"c-1":["\n",{"->":"1Epilogue"},"done",{"#f":5}]}],{"#f":1}],"1Epilogue":["^<h3>","ev",{"VAR?":"1EpilogueTitle"},"out","/ev","^</h3>","\n","^You find yourselves sitting at the Blue Mug when the serving maid Jane comes up to you.","\n","^\"Welcome weary adventures!\"","\n","end",{"#f":1}],"2Preface":[[{"#":"audio: fx-valleys"},"^<em>Welcome weary adventurer!

<em>Previous night at the Blue Mug.</em> 
A distraught woman comes in.
Distraught woman: pleads "Someone help please! "My husband has gone missing in the salt mine."
Distraught woman: Starts to tear up. "I don't have much money, but I need him back!"
    + Everyone knew the perfect party of adventurers for the job [.]<>
-, but that party isn't in Canis Villa right now. Last people had heard, they are off on some grand adventure for the queen.
- No one really wants this sort of job. It offers little in the way of reward and plenty in the form of danger.
- {TheFighter} speaks up from your party.
    + <>{TheFighter}: "We shall locate your lost husband my lady." #Fighter
    + <>{TheFighter}: "Why don't you ask the mining company?" #Fighter
        -- She says, "I just came from the mining company. The mining bosses won't help."
- {TheFighter} turns to the rest of you.
    + "Helping a lady in distress is the right thing to do."
- It'd be super awkward to say no now that {theFighter} has drawn her attention.
    + You: "Sure we can try to find him."
    + You: "I don't think this is our sort of thing."
        -- {TheCleric}: Turns to you and says, "Surely we can help this nice young couple out?"
            ++ You: "OK, fine"
- Everyone else in the party reluctantly agrees.
- "Thank you!" My name is {YoungMinerWife}. I pray you can find {YoungMiner}. {TheCleric} nods.
- {YoungMinerWife} gives you directions to the mine.
- The party decides to set out tomorrow morning.

<h3>{0EpisodeTwo}</h3> #location: mine arrival
The next day the party arrives at the mine without incident. There doesn't seem to be anyone around though which seems odd.
    + Make your way into the mine. #location: mine ambience
    + Look around outside.
    -- Seems like a typical mine entrance. You enter the mine.
- Tools of the trade such as pick axes and hammers are scattered haphhazardly. It would appear the miners left in a hurry. 
    + \ {TheRogue} spots blood.
    + \ {TheFighter} spots something shiny.
        -- {TheFighter} inspects the shiny object which turns out to be a couple silver coins. He pocKets the extra coin.
- {TheRogue} says, "There was a very nasty encounter in this tunnel. Judging by the amount of blood someone or something didn't fair very well."
    + You take a closer look at the blood. <>
        -- There is a lot of blood. 
            ++ [<em>WISDOM check pass</em>]
                --- You notice very large bloody paw prints from a quadraped heading deeper into the mine. They could be from a wolf or bear.
                Its probably time to move along.
             ++ [<em>WISDOM check fail</em>]
                --- You don't notice anything unusual except for the quantity of blood spilled.
    + Probably best to keeping moving along.
- How do you want to proceed down the tunnel?
    + You {MoveStealth} down the tunnel.
        ->tunnel_stealth

-{~Two|Three} menacing giant spiders at the edge of the torch light suddenly rush up the tunnel towards the party, chattering loudly. #spiders

    ++ <em>[Back to the action]</em>

- {TheFighter} hacks and slashes at the legs of one giant spider. {TheRogue} stabs at the multiple eyes on another giant spider and effectively blinds it. # magic-missle.mp3 #fleshy-stab.mp3
    + Flee. <>
        -- <em>Really? You want to run away from spiders?</em>
        ++ Continue to fight.
    + Continue to fight. <>
        -- \ {TheWizard} finishes them off with a volley of magic missiles! 
            ++ Victory <> # win.mp3
- The party defeats the giant spiders. 
    + "Let's see if there is anything to loot," {theRogue} says.
    + "Don't bother looting the spiders," {theCleric} says.
        -- "No harm in looking," {theRogue} says.
        ++ You take a quick look.
- One of the spiders has two lose fangs dripping with venom; courtesy of a shield punch from {theFighter}.
    + Carefully, {theWizard} holds a vial up to the fangs and collects some of the dripping venom.
    
- The clamoring of the battle has spooked a medium group (1d8) of bats from their perches farther in. They aren't in range yet. They seem to be staying close to the ceiling.
    + "Leave the bats alone" {TheWizard} cautions.
    + "Crossbow is ready!" {TheFighter} says.
- Your party opts to leave the bats alone. They fly overhead harmlessly and leave you alone.

Not much longer you find two bodies, presumably miners. A third that stirs ever so slightly when hearing you approach. 
TODO: Healing spell stats
<em>What to do...</em>
    + "Perhaps I should perform a minor healing spell (1d8)?" asks {theCleric}.
        -- You say "I was thinking the same thing." {TheCleric} performs a <em><Minor Healing</em>.
    + "I'll give him a <em>potion of healing</em> (2d4 + 2)" you say.
        -- You take the potion out of your pack and have him drink it.
    + "He seems more dead than alive. Let's leave him." {TheRogue} says.
        -- "You can't be serious?!" {TheCleric} asks. He performs a minor healing spell.
#audio: cleric spell
- The man stablizes. 
- You asks, "Who are you?"
    + He says, "My name is {YoungMiner}."
- He continues, "My young wife should be quite thankful you found me." He chuckles and coughs a bit of blood, "I am also quite thankful you found me."
"Yes, your wife is the one who sent us to look for you {YoungMiner}." you say.
{TheWizard} asks, "What happened here?"
{YoungMiner} replies, "We were attacked by a large beast."
A booming roar fills the tunnel. #audio: bear roar
    + "What the ..." utters {theFighter}.
    -- {TheFighter} holds his torch out which reveals a large pair glinting eyes.
    + "<em>Lumos!</em>" says {theWizard}.
    -- {TheWizard}'s wand tip now glows softly and reveals a large pair glinting eyes.
    
TODO: Bear stats
- A large cave bear (<em>about 5 ft at shoulder height, +900 lbs</em>) opens its maw and roars again. #audio: bear roar

The cave bear charges. <em>What do you do?</em>
    + <>{TheRogue} is the first to attack!
        -- {TheRogue} releases two throwing knives into the front shoulders of the cave bear. It barely pauses before crashing into the party. Everyone in the party takes bludgeoning damage.
    + <>{TheWizard} casts a quick cantrip (spell)!
        -- {TheWizard} reflexively fires three magic missiles at the cave bear. It barely pauses before crashing into the party. Everyone in the party takes (d) bludgeoning damage.
    + <>{TheFighter} steps in front.
        -- '{TheFighter} quickly brings his buckler up. The impact splinters the shield into dozens of pieces and throws him into the side of tunnel. {TheFighter} takes (d) bludgeoning damage. {TheFighter} remains stunned for the next (1+1d4) rounds.
TODO: Look up bite damage
- The cave bear turns quickly and bites at {~{theRogue}|{theFighter}|{YoungMiner}} doing additional damage. #bite
- You realize that the injured man and at least half of your party are in no condition to move soon. Something needs to be done to draw the beast away.
    +  Smash the vial of venom on the cave bear
    + [Poke the bear with a stick.]
        -- You consider poking the bear with a stick but your intution is "thar's a bad idea." Nor do you have stick at the moment.
- You hurl the vial of spider venom at the bear's face while {theWizard} simultaneously blast the beast with a lightning bolt for (1d) damage and (1d) damage.
    + [>>]
        -- The bear stands up on its hind legs to a full 9 feet before the ceiling prevents it from going further. #stand

// Only the rogue's uncanny reflexes save him as he takes a grazing, but damaging hit from one of the razor sharp claws.
// You remember a vial of acid stashed in your pack. You pull it out as quickly and uncork the vial. {TheWizard} is standing next to you.
- It was too much to hope for that the cave bear would run off. It falls and rolls on the ground. Then it gets up and charges you.
    + You shove {theWizard} aside.
        -- As you hoped, the bear ignores {theWizard} and chases you.
        -> 0Ep2_END
    + You shove {theWizard} towards the bear.
        -- Both the bear and {theWizard} look surprised. The cave bear ignores {theWizard} and chase you.
